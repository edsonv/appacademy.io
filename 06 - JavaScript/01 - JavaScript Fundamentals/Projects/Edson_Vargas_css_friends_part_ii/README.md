Divide the sidebar up into three sections: `.profile-picture`, `.profile-info`, and `.profile-nav`.

Have the `.profile-picture` be a link that contains an image tag with the provided `./images/cat.jpg` picture. Make the link a `block` element and style it. Thanks to your earlier reset, the image will now expand to fill the full width of the link.

To pull the `.profile-picture` partly out of its sidebar section, use a negative `margin-top`. This is better than absolute positioning, as it is still in the document flow, and won't leave a gap, but pull everything up with it.

To make sure it is in front of the `.content-header` section, you will have to position it `relative`. You do not need to nudge it (we used `margin-top` to do that) or give it a z-index. As they're now both `relative`, order of appearance on the page dictates the stacking order. This is in our favor, as `.profile-picture` is declared later.

To get the divider lines between all the `.profile-nav` list elements, but also at the top and bottom, you'll want to use a pseudo selector like `:first-child`, `:last-child`, or `:nth-child()`.

### **Before You Move On:**

Remember! All of our CSS files are included in our `cats.html` file through the use of `<link>` tags in the document's `<head>`:
~~~html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>App Academy Friends</title>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/06-sidebar.css" type="text/css">
</head>
~~~

Phase 0's `<link>` tag is already included, but you'll be responsible for adding the rest!

Celebrate being online with a a nice ribbon! Put an `.online` element inside of the `.profile-picture` link. Position it absolute to be on top of the image. Then go bonkers styling it using fancy `transform` properties like `rotate()` and `translateX()`. Pay attention to typography and don't forget to add a tiny `box-shadow`.

A grid of friends! Use a list and flexbox every `<li>`! Spacing them out properly will be tricky. You will need to use `:nth-child()` pseudo-selectors to add some left and right margin to the middle of every three `<li>`s.

Create a `.thumb` class to style the links that contain the thumbnails. You can use the same `../docs/images/cat.jpg` picture for the `<img>` tag. We will want to reuse this `.thumb` class later.

Add `title` attributes containing friend names to the link tags. You should have something like: `<a href="#" class="thumb" title="Jonathan">`. Then use `:before` pseudo-content to grab this title and inject it into the link. Style this to make it a tool tip, making it a `block` element and position it absolute.

To position an `absolute` element in the center relative to its parent, use a combination of `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)`. The `left` percentage is relative to its parent, and will set the current element's left most pixel to half its parent width. Since this is too far to the left, we have to adjust this by subtracting half our own width. The `translateX()` value takes a percentage relative to itself, which is exactly what we need.

To create a little triangle below the tooltip, we'll need to inject more pseudo-content. Fortunately, we have two injection points, `:before` and `:after`. Since we used `:before`, we will now use `:after`. Look at [this demo](http://appacademy.github.io/css-demos/triangle.html) for a demonstration of how you can make a triangle out of borders.

Reuse your `.thumb` class. Use flexbox to position the thumbnail and the form next to each other. Wrap your inputs and labels in container elements with an `.input` class. Wrap the button in a `.submit` container. Style them so you can reuse them. Pay special attention to the `:focus` and `:active` pseudo-classes.

**Bonus:** CSS can do math too! Though not required today, you may use the `calc()` function. It can be especially nice to do math with combined units. For instance, you can easily subtract 100px off of a 100% width, by setting `width: calc(100% - 100px)`. You can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can even use parentheses to denote order.

## **Phase 4: Posts**

### **Topics:**

Crush this using semantic tags and your flexbox skills. How about using pseudo-content to inject little bullets `Â·` in between the list items?

Icons make things look so good! And lucky you, we're going to use a technique called a _sprite_. This is one image file that contains many smaller images. We combine them to dry up our CSS, but most importantly, to reduce HTTP request overload. We only have to fetch one image, instead of many. This makes things crazily snappy!

Check out our [sprite](https://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/micro-projects/css-friends/docs/images/sprite.png). Then look at the [specs](https://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/html-css/micro-projects/css-friends/docs/SPECIFICATIONS.md).

We will create a slew of icon classes, one for each icon. We will prefix each class with `.icon-`. Let's start off with the post icons, create classes for `.icon-comment`, `.icon-reblog`, and `.icon-favorite`.

Add these classes to the `<a>` tags you wrote in the previous phase.

Back in your CSS, you can select all of these classes using the `[class*="icon-"]` pseudo-selector. Let's first write some general rules that apply to all icons. Set the supplied `../docs/images/sprite.png` image as the background image. You will want to set the `background-size` property to the specs' sprite size, as the sprite image is in double resolution for retina screens.

Then set the display property of all icons to `inline-block`. This allows us to set a width and height. Set a `width` and `height` of `25px` as per the specs. Go look at the results. Notice the background image with the text on top of it.

We want to get rid of the text, but we do not want to take it out of our HTML, as it conveys meaning. Let's use CSS to push the text out of the box! First add a `overflow: hidden` rule. See how that clips off the text at the sides?

Now let's push out the text completely. Remember how padding is part of an element and shows the background image? Let's use a `padding-top` that is equal to the height, and set the `height` to `0`. This effectively pushes the text outside the box, as it does not fit in a `0` height element. Our overflow settings then proceed to clip it off. Check it out!

Next up, start showing the correct part of the sprite for each class we wrote. In each individual icon class selector we will only have to set the `background-position` coordinates.

Once we have these in place, also create selectors with the `:hover` state.

For the small icons we're going to use the `.icon-small-` prefix. Go ahead and flesh those out.

We can then select all of them with the `[class*="icon-small-"]` selector. Notice how the general rules of our earlier selector will also apply. We can override the `width` and `padding-top` for the small icons.

When it comes to applying these icons to our HTML, we don't want these smaller icons hiding the text of the links, rather we want them to be an addition. For this we will repurpose the `<i>` tag, which seems suitable for an icon.

Go ahead and add empty `<i>` tags with icons classes inside of links on the page. You'd end up with something like this: `<a href="#"><i class="icon-small-wall"></i> Wall</a>`.
